# Lions Hackathon!

Our app is located at: [http://www.cubclub.club](http://www.cubclub.club)

## The Problem

Each year 640,000 babies are born in the UK. Worldwide it's 140m meaning every year, that's how many children start the process of learning to read.ðŸ“š Anyone who has ever taught anyone to learn to read will understand the challenge of starting the literacy journey!

## The Goal

The teams were tasked with creating a web app to make learning interactive and fun. They could take any technical approach they wanted and had to present their creative solution to the judges by 5pm that same day.

## The Rules

None! We were instructed to use anything we could to make a fun interactive app.
